        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          "All keys lost" refers to a situation where a vehicle owner has lost all available keys and fobs for their
          vehicle, leaving them with no way to access or start their car. This is considered more complex than losing
          just one key because it requires complete key reprogramming.

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Always keep a spare key in a safe place and consider getting duplicate keys made before losing all keys. This
          can save significant time and money in the long run.
